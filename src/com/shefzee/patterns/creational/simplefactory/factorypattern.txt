It is a creational design pattern which talks about the creation of an object.
The factory design pattern says that define an interface ( A java interface or an abstract class)
 and let the subclasses decide which object to instantiate.
 The factory method in the interface lets a class defer the instantiation to one or more concrete subclasses.
